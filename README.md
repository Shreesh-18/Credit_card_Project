Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using various classification algorithms and a dataset of credit card transactions, the project identifies patterns that differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent activities.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing transaction data to uncover patterns and insights.
Model Training: Implementing and comparing various machine learning models including Logistic Regression
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy
Deployment: Providing a framework for deploying the trained model to detect fraud in real-time.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset presents transactions that occurred over two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
